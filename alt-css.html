      <p>Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. We don't have a brig. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.</p>

      <p>Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. We're also Santa Claus! Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.</p>

      <p>You can see how I lived before I met you. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Fry, we have a crate to deliver.</p>

      <p>Shut up and take my money! Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Shinier than yours, meatbag. And until then, I can never die?</p>

      <p>Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!</p>

      <p>Who are those horrible orange men? And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! Bender, quit destroying the universe!</p>
